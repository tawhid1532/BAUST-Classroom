# BAUST-Classroom
Academic Project
Here is the code and sql file. (name - classroom.sql). 

Step 1. At first check if your Xampp/ Wamp is updated/recent version. Old version may create problem, 
because it worked in a recent verion.

Step 2: Download the files from the repository. and save it to htdocs folder of Xampp. If you use Wamp 
then save it in www folder.

Step 3: Import the database. database name shoud be "baustclassroom" if not then change it in "db.php" file.

Step 4: Run it. And Register some student account and some teacher account.

Then play around with it and find if there is any bugs to be solved of improvements to be made and let me know.

If you cannot run it or there is any problem in running it let me know, but it's better to be comfortable with 
it on your own.  

Create new "Online Exam", "Q&A", "Resource Sharing", "Attendance", "chat" and "notice" and test it properly.

"It is important to have an internet connection at run time."
